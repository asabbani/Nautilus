# Workflow

This page details the three stage testing process at Yonder Deep.

| Phase           | Purpose                                                | Branch            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Alpha           | local development and testing for one particular issue | varies            |
| Beta            | integration testing for feature complete code          | development       |
| Production      | fully functional code that has been thoroughly tested  | master            |

## Stage 1 - *Alpha*
Alpha testing refers to local develoment by a sub-section of the team for a particular issue. This development is done on its own branch and should be tested
with an AUV and Basestation radio connection before being merged with the development branch.
### Procedure:
#### Create a Ticket
1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/Yonder-Deep/Nautilus/issues) page and create a **New Issue** with a relevant title and description.

2. Add your issue to the Github Project [board](https://github.com/Yonder-Deep/Nautilus/projects/3) by dragging it from the "Add cards" panel.

#### Working on a Ticket
1. To start working on a ticket, create a local branch from `main`. Titling of branch names should follow this format:  
    `<Ticket Number>/<Title Abbreviation>`  
 
    You can get the ticket number from the Github issue page. An example branch name would be: `1/first-ticket`. To create the branch, make sure you are in the `main` branch and then use `git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME>`.

2. Work on your ticket within your branch, make occasional pulls and merges from main to make sure your code works with the latest changes (ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE ACTUALLY ON THE CORRECT BRANCH, you can check this by doing git branch):
    ```
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    git checkout <YOUR BRANCH>
    git merge develop
    ```
3. Add and commit changes when appropriate:
   ```
   git add <FILE>
   git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
   ```
   Commit messages should be present imperative. Example: "Add support for data transfer"
4. Push your changes to Github:
   ```
   git push
   ```
   If you are pushing your branch to Github for the first time, you will have to do this instead:
   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH NAME>
   ```
 
 #### Submitting a Pull Request
 1. On Github, go to "Pull requests" and create a new pull request by selecting your branch for the ticket.
 2. In the description of the pull request webpage, add:
    
    `Closes #<Issue Number>`
 3. **Make sure** you select develop as the branch being merged to.
 4. After having your PR reviewed, merge with the develop branch. 

## Stage 2 - *Beta*
Beta refers to testing conducted on a subset of features that need to be tested with a fully set-up AUV and Basestation. This will most likely consist of a pool
test or something of a similar calibar. These tests are to be conducted periodically (dates TBD).

## Stage 3 - *Production*
Production refers to the stable and fully tested code base. This code should only be updated after features on the develop branch thoroughly work as expected.
